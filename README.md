## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Scrape publicly available voting/election-related information using **BeautifulSoup**
- Perform data cleaning, merging, and enrichment using **Excel** (VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables)
- Analyze and visualize meaningful patterns using **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**
- Build interactive visualizations and dashboards using **Flourish**

This workflow reflects a complete **data analytics pipeline** — from raw data collection to insight generation.
